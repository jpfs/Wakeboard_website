      <p class="lead">
        Ready to embark on your wakeboarding journey? Here's a guide to help you
        get started.
        <br />
        When you arrive on the cable don't be shy, always talk to the staff let
        them know you are new in the sport and for sure they will help you out,
        wakeboard is the most inclusive sport that i know and believe me i have
        done a lot of them.
        <br />
        Listen to have the staff have to say and remember you are there to
        having fun, it is normal that you will fall your first couple of tries!
        Shake it off and try again don't worry you will get it, it took me 2 day
        do ride for 5 seconds strait, and now 6 years later i can do 900ยบ
        rotation of a kicker.

        <p class="lead">
          Ready to gear up for your first ride? Here's your must-have
          wakeboarding checklist:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Life Jacket:</strong> Your best friend on the water! Make
            sure it's snug but comfortable - you'll be wearing it all day. Pro
            tip: get one specifically designed for wakeboarding to maximize your
            movement.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Helmet:</strong> Your brain's bodyguard! Essential for cable
            parks where obstacles are involved. Trust me, it's better to have it
            and not need it than need it and not have it. Besides, it'll give
            you more confidence to try new things!
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Wakeboard:</strong> Your ticket to ride! For beginners, go
            for a longer, wider board - it'll give you more stability as you're
            learning. Don't worry about getting anything fancy yet; most parks
            have rental boards perfect for starting out.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Optional But Nice:</strong> Impact vest for extra
            protection, water-resistant sunscreen (trust me on this one), and a
            good attitude - you're about to have a blast!
          </li>

        <h2 class="text-center text-primary">Choosing Your First Wakeboard</h2>
        <p class="lead">
          Let's find your perfect board! Here's what to consider for your new
          water companion:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Size Matters:</strong> For beginners, longer and wider
            boards (135-140cm) offer better stability and easier starts. As a
            general rule, the heavier you are, the longer your board should be.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Rocker Type:</strong> Start with a continuous rocker
            (smooth, consistent curve) - it's more forgiving and perfect for
            learning. Three-stage rockers are great for advanced tricks, but
            let's master the basics first!
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Cable vs. Boat:</strong> For cable parks, look for boards
            with reinforced edges and a more flexible design. They'll handle the
            obstacles better and last longer against rails and kickers.
          </li>

            <strong>Pro Tips:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Don't splash big money on your first board - focus on learning
              </li>
              <li>
                Most cable parks offer rental packages with quality beginner
                boards
              </li>
              <li>
                Demo different boards if possible - feel the difference yourself

      <h2 class="text-center text-primary">Learning the Basics</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        Before hitting the water, here are some key fundamentals you need to
        master:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Starting Position: Stand in waist-deep water, keep your board
          perpendicular to the cable, knees bent, and arms straight. Let the
          cable pull you up naturally - don't try to fight it!
        </li>
        <li>
          Body Posture: Once up, keep your back straight, knees slightly bent,
          shoulders relaxed, and look ahead (not down at your board). Stay
          centered over your board.
        </li>
        <li>
          Board Control: Start with your board flat on the water. For direction
          changes, apply gentle toe or heel pressure - no sudden movements!
          Think of it like steering a skateboard.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="lead">**Common Mistakes to Avoid**:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Don't pull on the handle - let the cable do the work</li>
        <li>Don't lean back too far</li>
        <li>Don't try to stand up too quickly from the water</li>
        <li>Don't look down at your board while riding</li>
