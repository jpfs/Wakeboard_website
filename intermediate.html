        <h2 class="trick-title">Raley</h2>
        <p class="trick-description">
          The Air Raley is a stylish trick where you launch yourself backward
          parallel to the water, creating a horizontal layout position in the
          air. Starting with a progressive edge into the wake, lean back as you
          hit the kicker while keeping your legs straight and hips pushed
          forward, creating that distinctive laid-out position. Your arms should
          be steady on the handle, helping to maintain control throughout the
          trick. The key is to spot your landing early and bring your body back
          to a vertical position before touching down. This trick requires good
          core strength and commitment, but once mastered, it's one of the most
          impressive-looking basic aerial tricks and serves as a foundation for
          many advanced variations like Raley-based spins and flips.

      <!-- Back Roll -->
      <div id="back-roll" class="trick-section">
        <h2 class="trick-title">Back Roll</h2>
        <p class="trick-description">
          The Back Roll is a fundamental invert trick where you rotate backwards
          over your head axis, typically performed off a kicker. As you
          approach, maintain a steady speed and when you hit the kicker, lean
          back while pulling up with your front shoulder to initiate the
          rotation. Keep your eyes focused on spotting your landing and your
          body compact during the flip. The handle position is crucial - keep it
          close to your hip throughout the rotation to maintain control. Landing
          with your board flat and knees bent will help absorb the impact. The
          Back Roll is often considered one of the first inverts to learn as
          it's relatively intuitive and provides a good foundation for more
          advanced aerial tricks.

      <!-- S-bend -->
      <div id="s-bend" class="trick-section">
        <h2 class="trick-title">S-bend</h2>
        <p class="trick-description">
          The S-Bend is an advanced aerial trick that combines a Raley position
          with a back roll rotation, creating a unique S-shaped motion in the
          air. Starting like a regular Raley, you'll lean back off the kicker
          while pushing your hips forward, but then add a back roll rotation by
          throwing your head and shoulders back. Your body will trace an
          S-pattern through the air as you rotate. Timing is crucial - initiate
          the rotation at the peak of your Raley position, and spot your landing
          early to prepare for touchdown. The S-Bend requires good air awareness
          and control, making it a challenging but impressive trick that opens
          the door to more advanced combinations.

        <h2 class="trick-title">HeelSide FrontSide 360ยบ</h2>
        <p class="trick-description">
          The Heelside Frontside 360 is an advanced rotation trick where you
          spin a full 360 degrees frontside after taking off from your heels.
          The approach is heelside into the kicker, and as you leave the lip,
          initiate the rotation by leading with your front shoulder while
          keeping your body compact. The key is to spot your rotation in
          segments: first look over your lead shoulder, then midway through spot
          your landing to complete the spin. Your handle control is crucial -
          keep it close to your hip to maintain a clean rotation. This trick
          builds on the fundamentals of the HS FS 180 but requires more
          commitment and better air awareness, making it a significant milestone
          in your kicker progression.

        <h2 class="trick-title">ToeSide BackSide 180ยบ</h2>
        <p class="trick-description">
          The Toeside Backside 180 is a rotational trick where you approach the
          kicker on your toes and rotate 180 degrees backside (rotating toward
          your back) in the air, landing switch. The unique aspect of this trick
          is that you'll be rotating "blind" since you're spinning towards your
          back side. Start with a toeside approach, and as you leave the kicker,
          initiate the rotation by leading with your back shoulder. Keep your
          head turning to spot your landing as early as possible, and maintain a
          compact body position throughout the spin. Your handle position and
          control are crucial for maintaining balance during the blind rotation.
          This trick builds foundational skills for more advanced backside
          rotations.

      <div id="tantrum" class="trick-section">
        <h2 class="trick-title">Tantrum</h2>
        <p class="trick-description">
          The Tantrum is a backflip variation where you perform a backward
          rotation off the kicker with a diagonal axis, rather than a straight
          back roll. As you approach the kicker, you'll edge in on your heels,
          and when you hit the lip, pull your back hand across your body while
          looking over your opposite shoulder to initiate the diagonal rotation.
          The trick has a distinct feel as it combines both flip and spin
          elements. The key is maintaining steady handle control and spotting
          your landing early. While it might look intimidating, many riders find
          the Tantrum more approachable than a straight backroll due to its more
          natural rotational axis. This trick is often a gateway into more
          advanced invert variations.

        <h2 class="trick-title">Front Roll</h2>
        <p class="trick-description">
          The Front Roll is an inverted trick where you perform a forward
          rotation off a kicker. The approach is similar to a regular jump, but
          as you leave the kicker, you'll tuck your chin to your chest and
          initiate a forward flip by pulling your handle towards your front hip.
          The key is to keep your body tight through the rotation and maintain
          grip control. During the flip, you'll want to spot the water early to
          prepare for landing. While Front Rolls can feel less natural than Back
          Rolls for some riders, they're essential for progression and open the
          door to many advanced front flip variations. Landing with your board
          flat and knees bent will help absorb the impact smoothly.

      <div id="stay-on-rails" class="trick-section">
        <h2 class="trick-title">Stay on Rails</h2>
        <p class="trick-description">
          Staying balanced on rails requires several key techniques and proper
          body positioning. Keep your board flat and centered on the rail, with
          your weight evenly distributed between both feet. Your knees should be
          slightly bent to act as shock absorbers and help maintain balance.
          Keep your shoulders parallel to the rail and your arms steady - avoid
          moving them excessively as this can throw off your balance. Most
          importantly, always look toward the end of the rail rather than down
          at your feet. Staying relaxed is crucial; if you stiffen up, you're
          more likely to fall. A common mistake is trying to correct your
          balance by moving your upper body - instead, make small adjustments
          with your feet and ankles. Speed is also important - hitting the rail
          too slow can make it harder to stay on, while a moderate, consistent
          speed helps maintain stability throughout the feature.

        <h2 class="trick-title">Transfer</h2>
        <p class="trick-description">
          The Boardslide is a fundamental rail trick where you slide sideways
          across the rail with your board perpendicular to it, requiring both
          balance and board control. Your feet should be evenly weighted with a
          small bend in your knees for stability. When approaching the rail,
          you'll need to rotate 90 degrees to get into position, with either a
          frontside approach (facing the rail) or backside approach (back to the
          rail). Keep your eyes focused on the end of the rail and maintain a
          steady posture throughout the slide. The trick ends with a smooth
          rotation back to your riding position. This trick serves as a gateway
          to more advanced rail maneuvers and helps build essential rail riding
          skills.

        <h2 class="trick-title">Presses</h2>
        <p class="trick-description">
          A Nose Press is a stylish rail trick where you shift your weight onto
          the nose (front) of your board while sliding along a rail or box. To
          execute this, approach the rail with a balanced stance, then once on
          the feature, gradually shift your weight forward over your front foot
          while slightly lifting your back foot. Keep your front arm forward and
          back arm back to help maintain balance in this position. Your eyes
          should stay focused on the end of the rail, not down at your board.
          The key is to maintain steady pressure on the nose without leaning too
          far forward, which could result in catching your edge. This trick not
          only looks smooth but also builds essential board control skills
          necessary for more advanced rail tricks and presses.

      <div id="snake-bite" class="trick-section">
        <h2 class="trick-title">Snake Bite</h2>
        <p class="trick-description">
          A Snake Bite is a flashy variation of a nose press where you quickly
          shift your weight to the nose of your board while still on your
          approach. This causes your tail to swing out to one side, creating a
          snake-like whipping motion before you get on the rail into a nose
          press. The key is timing - start the weight shift just before you
          reach the rail, allowing the tail of your board to 'bite' or whip
          around as you transition onto the feature. Your upper body should stay
          controlled and centered while your lower body executes the motion.
          This trick adds style to a regular nose press and shows good rail
          control, but requires confident edge control and precise timing.
          Landing properly in the nose press position is crucial for completing
          the trick smoothly.
