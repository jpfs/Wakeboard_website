        <h2 class="trick-title">HeelSide FrontSide 540º</h2>
        <p class="trick-description">
          The Heelside Frontside 540 is an advanced rotation trick where you
          spin 540 degrees (one and a half rotations) frontside while coming off
          the kicker from your heels. Start with a solid heelside approach, and
          as you leave the kicker, initiate the rotation by leading with your
          front shoulder while keeping your core tight. Handle control is
          critical - keep it close to your body through the first 360 degrees,
          then use it to control the final 180. The key is breaking down the
          rotation into segments: first rotation like a 360, spot momentarily,
          then complete the final 180 to land switch. This trick requires
          excellent air awareness, commitment, and proper technique as you'll be
          blind to your landing for part of the rotation. It's a significant
          milestone in kicker progression and opens the door to even bigger
          rotations.

        <h2 class="trick-title">ToeSide BackSide 360º</h2>
        <p class="trick-description">
          The Toeside Backside 360 is an advanced rotation trick where you
          approach the kicker on your toes and spin 360 degrees backside (toward
          your back). The toeside approach helps initiate the blind rotation as
          you leave the kicker. Lead with your back shoulder while keeping your
          core tight and handle close to your hips throughout the spin. The
          challenge is maintaining orientation during the blind rotation -
          you'll need to spot your landing by continuing to turn your head as
          you rotate. Breaking it down into phases helps: first 180 blind, spot
          midway, then complete the final 180 to ride away clean. The trick
          requires commitment and confidence since you're spinning blind, but
          the toeside approach makes the initiation feel more natural than its
          heelside counterpart.

        <h2 class="trick-title">HeelSide FrontSide 720º</h2>
        <p class="trick-description">
          The Heelside Frontside 720 is a high-level rotation trick where you
          spin two full rotations (720 degrees) frontside off a heelside
          approach. Starting with a strong heelside edge into the kicker,
          initiate the spin as you leave the lip by leading with your front
          shoulder while keeping your body compact. Handle control is crucial -
          keep it tight to your hip through the first 540 degrees, then use it
          to control the final 180. Breaking down the rotation helps: think of
          it as a 540 plus another 180. Timing is everything - you need to start
          the rotation early and spin fast enough to complete both rotations
          before landing. This trick requires exceptional air awareness,
          commitment, and proper technique, as you'll be blind to your landing
          during parts of the rotation. The HS FS 720 is a significant
          achievement in wakeboarding progression and demonstrates advanced
          control and aerial awareness.

        <h2 class="trick-title">Scarecrow</h2>
        <p class="trick-description">
          The Scarecrow is an advanced invert trick that combines a Front Roll
          with a Frontside 180. As you approach the kicker, you'll initiate a
          Front Roll, but during the forward rotation, you'll also add a
          180-degree frontside spin, making it a blend of flip and rotation. The
          key is timing - start the Front Roll first, then add the 180 rotation
          as you're inverted. This combination creates a unique and stylish
          looking trick where your body rotates on two different axes. Landing
          switch adds to the trick's difficulty. While it builds on the
          fundamentals of a regular Front Roll, the added rotation makes it
          significantly more challenging and requires good aerial awareness and
          commitment.

        <h2 class="trick-title">CrowMobe</h2>
        <p class="trick-description">
          The Crowmobe is an advanced aerial trick that combines a Front Roll
          with a Frontside 360. As you approach the kicker, you'll initiate a
          Front Roll, but during the flip, you'll also add a 360-degree
          frontside rotation. The key is proper timing - start with the Front
          Roll motion and blend in the 360 spin while inverted. The handle
          positioning is crucial to control both the flip and the rotation
          simultaneously. This creates a unique combination of inverted and
          rotational movements that requires excellent air awareness and
          commitment. The landing is particularly challenging as you need to
          spot your landing while managing both the flip and spin elements. The
          Crowmobe is a significant milestone in wakeboarding progression and
          opens the door to even more complex invert-rotation combinations.

        <h2 class="trick-title">Tantrum to Blind</h2>
        <p class="trick-description">
          The Tantrum to Blind is a stylish variation of the regular Tantrum
          where you add a handle pass at the end of the trick to land "blind"
          (with the handle behind your back). Start like a regular Tantrum with
          a heelside approach and diagonal backflip rotation, but as you come
          around and spot your landing, pass the handle behind your back from
          your front hand to your back hand. The key is timing - the handle pass
          should happen late in the rotation as you're setting up to land. This
          landing position is more technical than a regular Tantrum as you'll be
          riding switch with the handle behind your back. While the flip portion
          remains the same as a regular Tantrum, the added handle pass component
          significantly increases the trick's difficulty and style factor.

        <h2 class="trick-title">Rail to Rail</h2>
        <p class="trick-description">
          Rail to Rail is an advanced obstacle technique where you jump from one
          rail to another while maintaining your slide. The key is proper speed
          and distance assessment between the features. As you reach the end of
          the first rail, stay centered and pop off with both feet, keeping your
          eyes focused on your target rail. Your trajectory should be controlled
          - not too high, just enough to clear the gap. The approach angle to
          the second rail is crucial; try to match the angle you're coming off
          the first rail. Maintaining your body position during the transfer is
          essential to land in the same slide position you started with. While
          intimidating at first, rail transfers add a creative dimension to your
          riding and allow you to link features in unique ways. Start with
          shorter, easier transfers and gradually progress to more challenging
          gaps as your confidence builds.

      <div id="land-blind" class="trick-section">
        <h2 class="trick-title">Land Blind Consistently</h2>
        <p class="trick-description">
          Landing blind (with the handle behind your back) is a fundamental
          skill that requires proper technique and practice to master
          consistently. The key is in the handle rotation - as you pass the
          handle behind your back, keep your arms straight and allow your upper
          body to rotate with the pass. Your eyes should stay level with the
          horizon, not looking down at the water. Control the handle position by
          keeping it close to your lower back, approximately at waist height.
          Many riders make the mistake of bending their arms or hunching
          forward, which leads to unstable blind landings. Another crucial
          element is maintaining a centered stance over your board - avoid
          leaning back or sitting in your landing. Practice this first on
          regular jumps or small kickers before taking it to bigger features or
          combining it with other tricks. Consistency comes from building muscle
          memory and staying relaxed through the handle pass motion.
